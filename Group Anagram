Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

A2)
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Heap = {} 
for word in strs:
    key = ''.join(sorted(word)) 
    if key not in Heap:
        Heap[key] = []
    Heap[key].append(word)
print(list(Heap.values())) 


append() → only works on existing lists
New key → you must assign a list
