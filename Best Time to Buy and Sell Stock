You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
      You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
            Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

The rule
You must choose:
one day to buy
one later day to sell
Keyword: later.
Time only moves forward. No time travel, no regrets.

What the problem is really asking:
Not:
  “Find the biggest difference”
But:
  “Find the biggest difference where the smaller number comes before the larger one”
