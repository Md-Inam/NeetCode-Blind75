Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
Constraints:
Each input has exactly one solution.
You cannot use the same element twice.
Return in any order.

Sol-
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        Hash = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            difference = target - num
            if difference in Hash:
                return [Hash[difference], i]
            Hash[num] = i

Logic
Initialize an empty hashmap:
Hash = {}

Loop through the array with index and value:
for i, num in enumerate(nums):

Compute the needed number (difference) to reach target:
difference = target - num

Check if difference is already in hashmap:
if difference in Hash:
    return [Hash[difference], i]  # indices of the two numbers

If not found, store the current number and its index:
Hash[num] = i
