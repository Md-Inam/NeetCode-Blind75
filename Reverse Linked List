LeetCode shows: [1,2,3,4,5]
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None
Goal: [5,4,3,2,1]
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None
Then Temp=curr.next (To Copy)
and curr.next=None (Break the old link)
Remember: In single linked list, the tail’s next MUST be None

Core Idea

Only one pointer changes per iteration: curr.next.
prev = head of reversed portion so far.
curr = node currently being reversed.
temp = save the next node so we don’t lose the list.

A)
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        curr, prev = head, None
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
